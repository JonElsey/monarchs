1D MONARCHS test case. This is analogous to running the 1D melt model from
Buzzard, S. C. (2017) _Modelling melt lake formation on an ice shelf._

Run from the MONARCHS top level folder (assuming you have installed using `pip install -e monarchs`) using

`monarchs -i examples/1D_test_case/model_setup_1d_testcase.py`
